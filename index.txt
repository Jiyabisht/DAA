You are given an array of integers A you need to find the maximum sum that can be obtained by picking some non-empty subset of the array. If there are many such non-empty subsets, choose the one with the maximum number of elements. Print the maximum sum and the number of elements in the chosen subset
The grandest stage of all, Wrestlemania XXX recently happened. And with it, happened one of the biggest heartbreaks for the WWE fans around the world. The Undertaker's undefeated streak was finally over. Now as an Undertaker fan, you're disappointed, disheartened and shattered to pieces. And Little Jhool doesn't want to upset you in any way possible. (After all you are his only friend, true friend!) Little Jhool knows that you're still sensitive to the loss, so he decides to help you out. Every time you come across a number, Little Jhool carefully manipulates it. He doesn't want you to face numbers which have "21" as a part of them. Or, in the worst case possible, are divisible by 21. If you end up facing such a number you feel sad... and no one wants that - because you start chanting "The streak is broken!" , if the number doesn't make you feel sad, you say, "The streak lives still in our heart!" .Help Little Jhool so that he can help you!

There are N bags and each bag contains some coin(s). Your task is to select an integer  X  and remove all the bags in which the number of coins is equal to X  Divide the remaining bags into two non-empty groups such that:The number of coin(s) in each bag of the first group is strictly smaller than X The number of coin(s) in each bag of the second group is strictly larger than X The total number of coins of one group is equal to the other.-https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/binary-search/practice-problems/algorithm/bags-of-coins-7b1d612c/
You are given an array A of size N, and Q queries to deal with. For each query, you are given an integer X, and you're supposed to find out if X is present in the array A or not. Input: The first line contains two integers, N and Q, denoting the size of array A and number of queries. The second line contains N space separated integers, denoting the array of elements Ai. The next Q lines contain a single integer X per line. Output: For each query, print YES if the X is in the array, otherwise print NO.-https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/binary-search/practice-problems/algorithm/discover-the-monk/

Given a graph, design an algorithm and implement it using a program to find if a graph is bipartite or not. (Hint: use BFS) Input Format: Input will be the graph in the form of adjacency matrix or adjacency list.  Output Format: Output will be 'Yes Bipartite' if graph is bipartite, otherwise print 'Not Bipartite'.Sample I/O Problem II:
                   Input:
                    5
                    0 1 1 0 0
                    1 0 1 1 1
                    1 1 0 1 0
                    0 1 1 0 1
                    0 1 0 1 0
                    Output:
                    Not Bipartite
